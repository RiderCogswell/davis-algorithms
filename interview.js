// Fibonacci Sequence Algorithm - not great with recursion because the time comoplexity would become too high

// BETTER WITHOUT RECURSION BECAUS EHT ENUMBER OF STEPS WE ARE ASKING OF THE COMPUTER IS MUCH LOWER

// function that takes in a number - function num() 

// if num <= 2
    // return 1 (first two numbers in sequence)

// create new array with [1, 1]

// loop from i = 2 to num
    // push [i - 1] + [i - 2] to array

// return last item in array


// DUPLICATES 

// variable that tracks the value that is currently appearing the most
// variable that tracks count of most appearing

// loop through the array
//     start a counter for # of occurences
// loop again
//     compare each item
//         if same number shows up counter++

// if counter > current most appearing
//     update most variable to counters value

// return most appearing + value
